# E-Commerce-Analysis


## Overview
This project involves analyzing e-commerce transaction data to gain insights into sales patterns, customer behavior, and revenue distribution. The analysis is performed using a combination of Python for data cleaning and processing, SQL Server for data storage and queries, and Power BI for data visualization and reporting.

## Project Objectives

### Data Cleaning and Processing:
Clean and preprocess e-commerce transaction data.
Ensure data integrity and consistency.

### SQL Queries and Data Storage:
Import data into SQL Server.
Write SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data.

### Data Visualization:
Create interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI.
Develop visualizations to understand customer segmentation, revenue distribution, and sales trends.
